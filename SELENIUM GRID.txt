SELENIUM GRID

1. What is Selenium Grid?
Selenium Grid allows you to run the Test cases parallel across multiple machines. i.e running multiple tests at the same time against different machines, different browsers, and different operating systems. 

2. What are the advantages of Selenium Grid?
Selenium-Grid helps us to execute faster if we have many Test cases and if we are running then in parallel obviously the execution time will get reduced.
We can run on different environments, one machine can be Unix based machine others can be a windows based machine. We can run it on Mac as well where we can keep the machines in parallel and run.
Using selenium-grid we can perform cross-browser testing.
Can run a single test on multiple browsers at the same time.
Selenium-Grid supports distributed test execution. It allows running our tests in a distributed test execution environment.

3. When can we go for Selenium-Grid?
We can go for Selenium-Grid if we want to run the test cases faster or if we want to run them on different operating systems in parallel.

4. By using Selenium-Grid we can record the Test cases from other machines? If possible how can we record?
No, We cannot record the Test cases using Selenium-Grid.

5. Explain how selenium Grid works?
First Selenium Grid sent the tests to the hub and these tests will get redirected to Selenium Webdriver, which launch the browser and run the test. With entire test suite, it will run tests in parallel.

6. Can we use Selenium-Grid for Performance Testing?
Yes, we can use selenium-grid for Performance Testing.

7.How to run tests in multiple browsers in parallel? Is there any other option other than selenium grid?
You create a class with a method like below:

public class BrowserLaunch {
	WebDriver driver=null;
	// Pass parameter browser from testng.xml
	@Parameters(“browser”)
	public void initiateBrowser(String browser){
	// compare browser  information and then open respective browser
	if(browser.equals(“Firefox”)){
		driver = new FirefoxDriver();
	}
	else if{	
		\\set path to the IE driver
		System.setProperty(“webdriver.ie.driver”, “\iexploredriver.exe”);
		driver =new InternetExplorerDriver();
	}
	else{
		\\set path to the  Chrome driver
		System.setProperty(“webdriver.chrome.driver”, “\chromedriver.exe”);
		driver =new ChromeDriver();
	}
}

	//Now create ClassName class and call extend the above class
	@Test
	public class ClassName extends BrowserLaunch{

		public void Gmail(){
			driver.get(“http://www.gmail.com”);
		}
	}

19. What is a hub?
Hub is a computer which is the central point where we can load our tests.

20. How many hubs does selenium-grid have?
The selenium-grid has only one hub which is the master of the network.

21. What is Selenium-Grid Node?
Nodes are selenium instances which are used to run tests used by the hub.

22. How many nodes does selenium-grid have?
There can be one or more nodes in a selenium-grid.

23. Which jar files we need to work with Selenium-Grid?
We need to download and add following jar files to our selenium set up.

selenium-grid-hub-standalone-.jar
selenium-grid-remote-control-standalone-.jar
selenium-grid-tools-standalone-.jar
24. How do I start Selenium Grid hub from my machine?

By setting up “ant” set up on our system we can able to work with the grid. Once we download selenium-grid, we navigate them to distribution directory and execute the following command

ant launch-hub

25. How do I start Selenium Grid Slave Server from my machine?
We need to Navigate to download directory of Selenium gird and execute the following command – ant launch-remote-control. This would launch remote control server at port 555.

26. How do I start Selenium grid slave on a different port than 5555?
We can start selenium grid slave on a specific port by using the “-Dport” option followed by port number

ant -Dport=1111 launch-remote-control
ant -Dport=2222 launch-remote-control

27. How do I specify an environment while starting grid slave machine?
We can specify an environment using “-Denvironment” while starting selenium grid slave machine.
ant -Denvironment=”Safari on Mac” launch-remote-control

28. What are the additional logs available while working with Selenium grid?
You can find Selenium grid hub logs in “log/hub.log” and Remote Control logs in “log/rc-*.log” folder.

29.How do you start a hub in Selenium Grid?
By running the following command from command-line we can start hub in Selenium-Grid
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-xxxx.jar -role hub

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.3.1.jar -role node-hub

http://192.168.1.164:4444/grid/register-port 5555

After executing the command to return to the Hub and navigate the URL http://localhost:4444 or http://192.168.1.164:4444

-  How to set capabilities and browser types for Hub in Selenium Grid
 	//1. Defining desired caps
        DesiredCapabilities cap=new DesiredCapabilities();
        cap.setBrowserName("chrome");
        cap.setPlatform(Platform.MAC);

        //2. Chrome options definition
        ChromeOptions options=new ChromeOptions();
        options.merge(cap);

        String hubUrl = "http://192.168.1.94:4444/wd/hub";
        WebDriver driver=new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(hubUrl), options);

        driver.get("http://freecrm.com");
        System.out.println(driver.getTitle());
        driver.quit();
